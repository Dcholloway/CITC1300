        <h3>Bacon and Chocolate chips</h3>
        <p>These were originaly a canned product that was passed around many of the large corperations and was conceptualized as "Chocolate and Bacon soup extract". However we saw the potential and re-imagined it as Bacon and Choclate chips.</p>

        <h3>Waffle Keyboard</h3>
        <p>This was an idea cooked up not in the lab but by the boys in the offices. For weeks we were getting complaints about the distance from the office sections of the building being so far from the cafeteria. This handy thing was made to help keep those pensil-pushers feed and keep up productivity, and we made quite a pretty penny after we started selling them to other companys. </p>

            <h3>Clown Meat</h3>
            <p>As we all know, clowning and clown related activitys have quite the casualty rate. Even after modern advances in falling anvil helmets, and human cannonball saftey technology, fatailtys are unforunatly still high. While this is quite a tragety we also saw it as an oppertunity, after years of expeimantation with leftover clown material, we decided to debut "Clown Meat". Acting as both a nutricious food product as well as a resiliant and flexable building material, this has become one of our most lucrative products.</p>
