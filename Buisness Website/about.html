            <h2>Our mission statment</h2>
            <p>We here at Big Buisness Inc have a vision, we see a way foward without chasing market trends or trying to follow what the big brands and corperstions are doing. We belive that the most effective way to do buisness is to find an under supported customer base. When our founder Thomas B. Buisness looked, he saw a near endless amount of customor bases that had needs so niche that no normal man would try to market to them. So, Instead of trying to service a small customer base with a small market, head made the bold decision to try and find as many niches as he could and fill all of them. And so we here at Big Buisness Inc have kept his vision alive for many year, with no idea to strange or unmarketable and no need to small or specfic to be met. </p>
